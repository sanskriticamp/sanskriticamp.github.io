							<h2>About the Camp</h2>
							<p>Sanskriti of NJ and Sanskriti School are pleased to announce their 8th Summer Camp. The 2 week camp dates are Aug 14th to 18th & Aug 21st to 25th, 2017. Like every year, we will be independently licensed.</p>
							<p>Sanskriti Summer Camp will include activities such as yoga, dance, music, cooking, desi sports etc. There are daily workshops based on weekly themes. This year's weekly themes are to be determined but themes from previous years were Indian landscapes & wild life, Indian architecture & monuments, Famous Indian personalities, life in Indian cities verses villages, festivals and such. </p>
							<p>In music, the camper's learn a fun Hindi song each week which is performed for parents on Friday evening. Similarly in dance, a Bollywood song dance is choreographed by a Sanskriti volunteer and performed by the kids on Friday. <b>Note: Music and Bollywood dance will be offered only if we get <a href=#volunteer> volunteers. </a></b></p>
							<p> Additionally the campers enjoy S.T.E.M. activities, arts & crafts and Desi sports like kabbaddi, kho-kho, cricket, badminton etc.  We even had a professional table tennis player who represented India in common-wealth games stop by to impress the kids one year.  In cooking session, a vegetarian kid-friendly, nut free yet healthy item is cooked with the help of kids. This is a lot of fun for them. <b> Again, we need volunteers for sports & cooking session each day. </b> </p>
							<p> We accept limited number of kids each year since we want to give individual attention to our campers. NOTE: This year, the campers will be divided in two age appropriate groups for most of the activities. <b>The camp is managed by a professional camp director with several years experience in managing such camps along with 3 assistants. In addition, a few teen volunteers as well as an adult Sanskriti volunteer is present most of the day. </b></p>

							<h2> Volunteering </h2>
							<p> Similar to every year, we will accept a limited number of teen volunteers from community (rising high school freshmen, sophomores and juniors) at the India Immersion Camp. Camp dates this year are Aug 14-18 & Aug 21-25. <b>Teens will get volunteer hour certificate if requested.</b><br> Volunteers are asked to commit to at least one week but you can choose to come both weeks. Choose one or both shifts per day M-F between AM (9-12) & PM (1-4). <br> It's fun for teens to mentor & guide the younger kids during activities. They are given specific tasks to complete and are exposed to a structured atmosphere. The teens learn to interact with adults and other teens without electronic devices.
